# PEconomy
Minecraft economy plugin with dollar and euro wallets.

May work on MC version 1.12+ (Paper or Spigot), but tested only on 1.15.2. `api-version` not specified.
You can operate with two currencies by default: dollar and euro (second wallet may be donation for example).
Sure, you can add own currencies or remove defaults, easy :)
This plugin hook into Vault as economy provider and use [SKLibrary](https://github.com/SoKnight/SKLibrary) as dependency.
